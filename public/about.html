<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Keenan Jacobs. I live in South Africa, with aspirations of becoming a certified Web Developer by the end of 2024.
  The excitement of this course is unexplainable, I keep wanting to move onto the next module once completing the current one.
</p>

<p>Hobbies include Anime, weight training, watching movies and series with my BEAUTIFUL Wife.</p>

<p>I believe I can make something of myself in this new chapter of my life and hopeful for what the future has in store for me.</p>
